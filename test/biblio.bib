	to, and the rating questions. The software then generates and delivers
	unique questionnaires for each participant, while managing the data
	collection process. The present article describes {OR-Vis}, its installation
	process, and how to use it to gather data. {OR-Vis} is open-source

	for pain-related variables (pain-related disability, school absence,
	pain intensity) and emotional distress. RESULTS: We found statistically
	and clinically significant changes in all variables. After 1 year,
	the majority (56\%) showed overall improvement as indexed by decreased
	pain-related disability or school absence. 22\% had an unsuccessful
	treatment outcome. Those showing only short-term improvements had
	higher levels of emotional distress at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: 1 year
	after completing a multimodal inpatient program adolescents report
	less chronic pain, disability, and emotional distress. Clinically
	significant changes remain stable. Adolescents with high levels of
	emotional distress at admission may require special attention to
	maintain positive treatment outcomes. Specialized inpatient therapy

	patients and in homogeneous subsamples. Ratings of maximal pain intensity
	(0-10 numeric rating scale, NRS) and pain-related disability were
	collected in a sample of 2249 children with chronic pain managed
	in a tertiary pain clinic. First, the "optimal" cut points for the

	points was quantified by the bootstrap technique. Third, this variability
	was also assessed in homogeneous subsamples of 650 children with
	constant pain, 430 children with chronic daily headache, and 295
	children with musculoskeletal pain. Our study revealed 3 main findings:
	(1) The optimal cut points for mild, moderate, and severe pain in
	the whole sample were 4 and 8 (0-10 NRS). (2) The variability of
	these cut points within the whole sample was very high, identifying
	the optimal cut points in only 40\% of the time. (3) Similarly large
	variability was also found in subsamples of patients with a homogeneous
	pain etiology. Optimal cut points are strongly influenced by random
	fluctuations within a sample. Differences in optimal cut points between
	study groups may be explained by chance variation; no other substantial
	explanation is required. Future studies that aim to interpret differences

  journal = {Diabet Med},
  year = {2012},
  month = {Apr},
  abstract = {Aim  Sensory diabetic neuropathy, determined by nerve conduction studies,
	is common in children with Type 1 diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy diagnoses
	are rarely made in paediatric daily care because they are asymptomatic,
	vibration detection is mostly normal and nerve-conduction testing
	is impractical. The present study aims to: (1) describe somatosensory
	dysfunction in children with diabetes, (2) test whether diabetes
	duration and HbA(1c) are related to somatosensory dysfunction and
	(3) identify the best screening test for large-fibre dysfunction,
	as indicated by nerve conduction studies. Methods  Forty-five children
	(age 13.2 ± 2.5 years) with Type 1 diabetes for 6.7 ± 2.5 years and
	matched control subjects were assessed by neurological examinations,
	nerve conduction tests and quantitative sensory testing on the feet
	using the protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic
	Pain. Abnormal nerve conduction was used as gold standard to define
	neuropathies. Results  We found a high prevalence of mechanical (38\%)
	and thermal (24\%) hypoesthesia often associated with hyperalgesia
	(47\%). Tactile hypoesthesia (33\%) was more frequent than pallhypaesthesia
	(11\%). Only cold detection and mechanical pain thresholds were related
	to HbA(1c) . Tactile hypoesthesia had the highest sensitivity (89\%),
	specificity (75\%) and positive (89\%) and negative (75\%) predictive
	values for neuropathies defined by nerve conduction tests (31\% abnormal).
	Conclusions  Almost half of the children with diabetes have subclinical
	large- and small-fibre neuropathies. Tactile detection was better
	than vibration for neuropathy assessment. Quantitative sensory testing
	is a valuable tool for assessment of neuropathy as well as a target
	of interventional studies in children with diabetes. © 2012 The Authors.

  abstract = {There are controversial discussions regarding developmental- and sex-related
	differences in somatosensory perception, which were found, eg, when
	comparing younger children (6-8years), older children (9-12years),
	and adolescents (13-16years) using quantitative sensory testing {(QST).}
	The aim of our current study was to systematically assess the impact
	of age and sex using the {QST} protocol of the German Research Network
	on Neuropathic Pain {(DFNS).} {QST}, including thermal and mechanical
	detection and pain thresholds, was assessed in 86 healthy 7-year-old
	children (42 girls and 44 boys) and 87 healthy 14-year-old adolescents
	(43 girls and 44 boys). The sample size was calculated a priori to
	detect medium-sized effects as found in the previous studies with
	adequate power. Developmental and sex differences were tested using
	univariate analysis of variance. Children were more sensitive to
	most pain stimuli, except cold pain stimuli, compared with adolescents,
	but did not differ in mechanical and thermal detection thresholds
	except in regard to cold stimuli. Sex had an impact only on warm
	detection, with girls being more sensitive. There were no interactions
	between age and sex. In conclusion, developmental changes during
	the puberty appear to influence pain perception, whereas sex effects
	in childhood are negligible. At present, it is not clear what brings
	about the differences between adult men and women that are apparent
	in epidemiological studies. Our results contradict the hypothesis
	that differences in peripheral nerve-fiber functioning underlie sex
	effects.},

  abstract = {Objective.- The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of
	pain descriptors (pain quality, pain intensity) assessed in a questionnaire
	to discriminate tension-type headache (TTH) from TTH plus migraine
	in a sample of adolescents. Background.- Epidemiological studies
	assess pain characteristics via questionnaire and estimate prevalence
	rates based on these pain descriptions. According to International
	Headache Society criteria, the subjective pain quality and intensity
	for TTH and migraine differs and therefore should be able to discriminate
	the 2 diagnoses. The discriminative ability between TTH and TTH plus
	migraine may be a special challenge. Design and methods.- One hundred
	twenty-two adolescents with pure TTH and 110 adolescents with TTH
	plus migraine aged 11-18 years presenting to a tertiary pediatric
	pain clinic were included in the study. Questionnaire reports of
	pain intensity and quality were compared with physician's diagnosis
	as the gold standard. Mean differences as well as receiver operating
	characteristics were analyzed. Results.- Adolescents with TTH plus
	migraine reported more pulsating and less intense pain compared with
	pure TTH. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that
	pain descriptors did not discriminate between groups. Diagnostic
	utility of descriptors was similarly low for older adolescents and
	parental proxy reports. Conclusions.- Pain intensity and quality
	assessed by questionnaires are not suitable to discriminate TTH from
	TTH plus migraine. This may lead to inaccurate prevalence estimates
	in epidemiological studies and may mislead practitioners in forming
	diagnostic hypotheses. The exclusion of these pain descriptors in
	questionnaires should be considered. More research systematically
	assessing the diagnostic utility of verbal pain descriptors in primary
	care and epidemiological samples is needed.},

  abstract = {Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS; formerly known as Morbus Sudeck/reflex
	dystrophy) is diagnosed in children and adolescents, but the clinical
	presentation is often atypical. Unfortunately, potentially harmful,
	invasive treatments are used in pediatric patients.A retrospective
	chart study of pediatric chronic pain patients with CRPS was performed.Over
	the course of 6 years, 37 (35 girls) children and adolescents took
	part in a multidisciplinary chronic pain inpatient program. At admission,
	patients took on average 4.4 (range 1-10) different medications and
	29 different pharmaceuticals were used overall. Prior to admission,
	invasive pain treatments were performed without success in 16 of
	the children (43%). At least 13 children received two or more invasive
	treatments. Although sympathetic blocks were most prevalent, operations
	and regional anesthesia were also used.Despite a lack of evidence
	for invasive procedures, these continue to be used in children and
	adolescents with CRPS, who later respond positively to conventional
	treatment. The English full-text version of this article is available
