# pandoc-apa6

## Synopsis

make_apa6.sh is a wrapper script for Pandoc to create APA6 compliant PDF from
markdown source.

## Code Example

make_apa6.sh <input.md>

## Motivation

Create APA6 compliant PDFs from markdown sources for my University research
papers.

## Installation

   * Create ~/.pandoc/templates if it does not exist.
   * Copy apa6.csl to ~/.pandoc
   * Copy pandoc-apa6.tex to ~/.pandoc/templates
   * Copy make_apa6.sh to your execution path (such as /usr/local/bin)

Edit the script make_apa6.sh to customize the affiliation, shorttitle,
bibliography file name, and output filename.

## Tests

Inside the test directory are some sample files to verify installation.
Included are:

   * biblio.bib: a sample bibliography in bibtex format
   * fig_2_whole_F.png: a sample image to be included in the output PDF
   * paper_v2.md: a sample markdown file
   * output.pdf: a sample output PDF pre-generated by the author.

Run make_apa6.sh against the test markdown source file:

	make_apa6.sh paper_v2.md

This will recreate output.pdf
